    <h2 class="subtitle">Initial Concept</h2>
   
    <p class="text"> Create a sense of passing time and repetition through the use of softwares where people spend large amounts of time. Show responses to complicated emotions, how we as a society experience and cope with them.</p>
    <div id="line2"></div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Explorations</h2>
    <ul id="list">
    <h3 class="subtitle2">Netflix</h3>
    <p class="text">Using Netflix’s My List to represent the time spent in isolation and quarantine. Movies and tv shows are colour-coded from red – intense, to white and black – indifferent, reflecting peoples’ feelings throughout time.</p>
    <img id="image1" src="img/Assignment1_Liza.jpg">
    <h3 class="subtitle2">Minecraft</h3>
    <p class="text">Using the video game Minecraft to create a visual structure that represents passing seasons, time and emotions. The spiral contains many repeating objects that are isolated from each other, guiding the viewer in repeating circles.</p>
    <img id="image2" src="img/Assignment1_Liza2.jpg">
    <h3 class="subtitle2">Tumblr</h3>
    <p class="text">Using social media website Tumblr to create a feeling of being overloaded and overwhelmed by the amount of time spent consuming various contents. Being trapped by the influence of social media versus being trapped from the outside world.</p>
    <img id="image3" src="img/Assignment1_Liza3.jpg">
    </ul>
    <div id="line3"></div>
    <h2 class="subtitle"> First Draft</h2>

    <p class="text"> Using Tumblr to incorporate and strategically place multiple tabs on the computer screen that include colour coded text, images, and various messages that express the overwhelming sense of being online and consuming content. The poster would explore the feeling of melancholy and hopelessness mixed with humour. Multiple screenshots will compose the final poster. </p>
    <img id="image4" src="img/1stDraft_Liza.jpg">
    <div id="line4"></div>
    <h2 class="subtitle"> Final Draft</h2>

    <p class="text"> Using more coherent pictures and screenshots that follow one idea at a time. Use big and bold text and keep away from monotonous blocks of text. Use images and text that guide the eyes through the poster. Create a design that conveys a message that appeals and makes sense to the average viewer.</p>
